of scores to be entered but assume that the user always enters at least one score. User
indicates the end of entry by entering a negative number to terminate the loop. (3 points)
Add this feature to your application: (1 point)
â€¢ If the user enters zero number of score, your application should ask the user to enter
at least one number otherwise the average cannot be calculated.
