With JavaScript (continue and break)(Week 4), do the following:
In the login process, check the folowing;
1. Create admin username and password for only for the admin and not for the normal user.
2. If the user enters admin password, prompt a prompt box to re-enter a password and give limit of 3 chances.[that's the break and continueÂ statement].
